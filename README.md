# PX402---Physics-Project-Repository
A repo for uploading algorithms and code for the PX402 project run by Alex and Ollie

### Current to-do list:
- write up results for fastest-Z algorithm; need sample data for both the un-thresholded and the thresholded data sets
- write up r-phi algorithm;
  - start with least squares sum over all
  - use weighting factor of r
  - use least-Z to prioritise point checking
