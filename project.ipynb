    "Event displays are useful. We encourage you to make extensive use of them in helping you to understand what you're algorithms are doing, both from the perspective of thinking through what you think your algorithm should do, where it might encounter problems, and also as a debugging tool - if you're trying to reconstruct a vertex location, plot it on the relevant event display, as this will be much easier to interpret than the raw numbers.\n",

This example provides a little insight into using different variables in View jointly (the process is similar for Event, though keep in mind most variables in Event are sets of arrays, not single blocks). It also provides some plotting details that will hopefully be useful for constructing future plots.\n",
    "\n",
    "The range of values of x and z covered by any given event is highly variable and so by default you can get some quite skewed aspect ratios from Python. So to help you understand what the events really look like it can be helpful to enforce a true aspect ratio, this is what get_fig_ratio supplies, and once you pick a size for a figure in x, you can use this to enforce a suitable scale in y via the figsize parameter of plt.subplots. You don't __have__ to do this, and sometimes using the true aspect ratio can be unhelpful if the ratio of z and x extents becomes very large/small, but if you have to think about angles between tracks this approach can prevent a lot of confusion.\n",

The binning is arbitrarily chosen to be 200 bins in each dimension, and the colour map and associated normalisation are specified. Again, these are arbitrary choices (you can omit them altogether), but I find this combination of colour map and normalisation to work reasonably well (i.e. a colour gradient that is easily interpreted from low to high values).\n",

This is often not actually true, and well written code, using core Python features like list comprehensions can be very fast (they're often compiled C code), but on large data sets, say 100,000 events or more, even very efficient code might take a minute or two, which will quickly get annoying in a debugging cycle, but for less Pythonic code with nested loops, this might turn into many hours, so for intermediate results in particular, you want to be able to run such steps once and then just load the result when you need to do some additional post-processing.\n",
