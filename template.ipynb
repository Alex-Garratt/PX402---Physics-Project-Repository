    "This sets up two classes, Events and View. The Events class holds all of the information loaded from a ROOT file (example usage is given below), as well as a couple of functions to help with filtering information by event number and PDG code. There's also a make_sequential function you don't need to worry about, which handles some technicalities around event number uniqueness. Examples using these filtering functions are given below.\n",
